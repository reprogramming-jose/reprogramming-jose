Here are some fun icebreaker games for a virtual work meeting:

### 1. Virtual Scavenger Hunt
Participants are given a list of items to find in their homes within a set time limit. The first person to return with all items or the most items wins[1][3].

### 2. Two Truths and a Lie
Each participant shares three statements about themselves: two truths and one lie. The rest of the team guesses which statement is the lie. This game helps team members learn interesting facts about each other[2][3][4].

### 3. Name That Tune
Play a snippet of a song and have participants guess the title and artist. This can be done with pre-recorded clips or live performances by team members[3].

### 4. Throwback Photos
Participants submit childhood photos before the meeting. During the meeting, everyone guesses which photo belongs to which team member. This game is a fun way to reminisce and learn more about colleagues' pasts[3].

### 5. Show and Tell
Each participant shares an item from their workspace or home that is meaningful to them. This can spark interesting conversations and help team members get to know each other better[4][5].

### 6. Online Games
Use platforms like Slack to play games such as trivia, where participants answer questions about various topics, or other interactive games designed for remote teams[1].

### 7. Pair & Share
Use breakout rooms to pair participants and give them a thought-provoking question to discuss. After a few minutes, everyone returns to the main room to share what they discussed. This allows for more intimate conversations and can be less intimidating for introverted team members[1].
